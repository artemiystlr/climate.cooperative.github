# **Welcome to the Climate Cooperative** [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-8A2BE2)](https://discord.com/channels/1234653337547440190)

The Climate Cooperative open source project is more than just software - it's a movement! We believe in the power of collaboration to tackle the monumental challenge of climate change. No single person, organization, or country can solve this crisis alone. It demands a global community of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and talents.

## **Mission**

This project is dedicated to advancing carbon-neutral, sustainable energy solutions for homes. Residential energy use is estimated to account for [20% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922205117). Achieving a 45% reduction by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050, as outlined by the Paris Climate Agreement, requires immediate action to transition residential energy use to sustainable sources.

We believe that the technology exists today for the residential sector to meet those benchmarks on time, but several obstacles stand in the way of that transition. We have identified 3 major obstacles that we believe must be addressed to achieve those goals in time:
1. **Education** - Many are unaware of their home's impact on carbon emissions, and even those who are aware may not know the choices available to reduce that impact.
2. **Affordability (The Green Premium)** - Upgrading to electric and energy efficient alternatives often costs significantly more than like-for-like replacements of old appliances, which discourages adoption of cleaner technologies.
3. **Workforce** - Installation of newer appliances often requires special training and there currently are not enough trained installers to meet the demands of a worldwide residential energy transition over the next decade.

Through the Climate Cooperative, we aim to unite brilliant and passionate individuals from varying domains and backgrounds to collaborate on solutions to these problems and more.

Our mission is to foster the development of a collection of relevant data, technology solutions, tools, processes, hardware and software that will be open-source and available to any individual, company, organization, school or foundation who wishes to use these tools to further the goal of reducing carbon emissions or to explore learning, creativity, research or education relating to climate change. The Climate Cooperative is the platform to unite everyone—regardless of origin, belief, or experience—in making a significant, positive impact on our planet. 

We firmly believe that the solutions to our shared future on this planet should also be shared and available to anyone or any group with the ingenuity, creativity and drive to improve them. Let’s succeed together.


## **Community**

We're just beginning to build our community, but we envision it becoming a vibrant and diverse hub of individuals who are deeply committed to fighting climate change. As a member of the Climate Cooperative, you'll have the chance to work alongside other dedicated and skilled individuals to pioneer the future of clean energy.

## **Projects and Applications**

### **In Development**

- **[Home Energy Assessment Database & API](https://github.com/Zwell-Home/home-energy-assessment-database)**: A unified platform for accurately calculating home carbon footprints, considering factors like local energy grids, local climate, and home appliances and attributes. A live proof-of-concept application can be found here: **[Home Energy Audit](https://zwell.bubbleapps.io/)**. The database and API aim to provide crucial data for energy savings tools, detailed analyses, and visualizations, empowering stakeholders to reduce residential energy consumption and promote sustainable solutions.

- **[Home Energy Audit App](https://github.com/climate-cooperative/home-energy-calculator)**: A front end application of the database and API above. Allowing users to provide information about their entire home through a web questionairre and then leveraging the database to convert that into a detailed breakdown of their home energy consumption—highlighting the most impactful updates they can make to their home.

- **[HVAC CO2 & Savings Calculator](https://github.com/climate-cooperative/hvac-savings-calculator)**: A fast, easy-to-use web app calculator that allows users to plug in basic details about their home and their heating and coolings systems and get immediate estimates of the carbon emissions of those systems, as well as recommendations for both reduced emissions and reduced energy costs.

- **[Water Heating CO2 & Cost Calculator](https://github.com/climate-cooperative/heat-pump-water-heater-savings-calculator)**: A fast, easy-to-use web app calculator that allows users to plug in basic details about their home and their water heating systems and get immediate estimates of the carbon emissions of their home’s water heating, as well as recommendations for both reduced emissions and reduced energy costs.

### **New Ideas and Project Proposals**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out the [Ideas](https://github.com/orgs/climate-cooperative/discussions/categories/ideas) on our Discussions page to propose a new idea (or review the community's latest ideas and find a project that inspires you)!

The goal is to develop solutions to support the transition to net zero carbon emissions from home energy consumption. There may be—and almost certainly are—many more great ideas not yet proposed here. If you've got an idea for a software application that could make an impact on that goal, make a new post in [Ideas](https://github.com/orgs/climate-cooperative/discussions/categories/ideas) and let's get the community talking about it!
